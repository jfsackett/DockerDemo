# Docker Demos
### Author: Joseph Sackett

These projects illuminate useful and interesting aspects of Docker containerization technology.
Currently there is one demo project:
1. [DockerJava](./DockerJava) - Tips and techniques for common Java development use cases

More examples coming in the future.  
The installation and execution instructions are very simple and this documentation is located in the project directories just below here.
